# Finding Your Passion and Purpose

"I used to think that success was about achieving some kind of destination. But the more I learned, the more I observed all those successful 
<br/> <br/> people, the more I realized that success is actually about the journey. And that journey begins with a single question: *What do you want to do?*

You have to figure this out, even before thinking of surpassing the crowd in front of you. Today, in this letter, I will help you answer that question and make you aware of your life's purpose. **So before reading this, I want to let you know that this will be a 5-part series and this is part 1.** Over the next few weeks, we'll dive deeper into the strategies and mindset shifts you need to surpass 99% of people and achieve your goals.

So reset your mind, and try to actively read as much as you can."

## Find Your Passion and Purpose

You cannot achieve anything in your life unless you know the answer to this fundamental question:

**What exactly excites you? What makes you want to wake up the next day and work towards it?**

To become better than most people, you need to be fully self-aware. Grab a notebook, sit down, and write about the things that interest you, things that you can do for hours. For me, it is design and code—something that I can do for hours and can make me money or even a business.

> *"Remember, when you're doing something you love, you'll naturally be better at it than others who are just going through the motions, whether it's a job or a business. Your passion will shine through, and people will take notice. So, take your time, and really think about what gets you excited."*

I said all of that because, after observing the best of the best, I have come to believe that this is the secret sauce that sets them apart from those who are merely mediocre. It makes them more driven and resilient.

### What If You Don't Have Any Interests or Passion?

I know that everyone may not have a clear path, and that's okay because I was the same. You know, it took me one whole year to finally figure out what I really liked. Before that, I used to switch between different things, and then finally, it happened. This proves that sometimes, our interests evolve—so you're not alone.

You just have to try out different things, take risks, and experiment. For me, it was about creating something from scratch, and that led me to design and code (tech) and writing about it, of course. You might be surprised at what you discover about yourself when you take the leap and start exploring.

> *"And I know that pursuing these things will lead me towards a better future, whether it's a business or personal satisfaction. If you're tired of feeling stuck in the race and want to build a business or make a substantial income that gives you the lifestyle you desire, then it's important to choose a pursuit that has the potential to generate real income."*

Think about it—when you're doing something you love and get paid for it, you can design your life on your own terms. That's ultimate freedom.
