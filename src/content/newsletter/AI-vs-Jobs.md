In this age where people are in a constant fear of being replaced by AI.<br/><br/>

They want a career which is AI proof, but that is just not possible. Every single field will be affected by AI directly or indirectly.<br/><br/>

But it is easy to know, if you are in the danger zone, of being replaced.<br/><br/>

There's a way to stay ahead of the game. It all comes down to one thing: influence.<br/><br/>

Everything in today’s digital world revolves around attention and influence. Your job or business’s safety is directly proportional to the amount of influence that it can have on people.<br/><br/>

If your skill set has the ability to influence people, then you won't be replaced.<br/><br/>

Artists are being replaced because the majority of the people all around the world don't really think about art in their day to day lives.<br/><br/>

But anime artists and writers are still in demand because they create content that people love and actively watch. They INFLUENCE people's lives, and that's what makes them valuable.<br/><br/>

Think about it.<br/><br/>

People care about what politicians have to say, what their favorite celebrities are up to, and what's trending on social media. They care about the content that influencers and content creators produce because all of this influences their lives.
<br/><br/>
So, what's the secret?<br/><br/>

It's influence. If your job can influence people, you'll be okay.<br/><br/>

Businesses need people who can influence others to succeed. That's why engineers, product designers, and others who can create impact are still in demand. They help businesses grow and thrive.<br/><br/>

So, focus on building your influence, and you'll be safe in the age of AI.<br/><br/>

It's not about being AI-proof; it's about being valuable to others.<br/><br/>

It's about creating impact and influencing people's lives.<br/><br/>

See you in the next one.<br/><br/>
